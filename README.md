This repository contains a few beginner-friendly LeetCode problems. These questions help build confidence with arrays, loops, and basic logic. Each problem is simple, clear, and great for improving problem-solving skills step-by-step.

## 1️⃣ 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

- For each kid, check if giving them extra candies makes them have the most candies.

- Helps understand comparing values in an array.

- Returns a list of true/false based on who can reach the maximum.

## 2️⃣ 1480. Running Sum of 1D Array

- Calculates the running total of numbers from left to right.

- Helps practice loops and keeping track of a growing sum.

- Great for understanding how prefix sums work.

## 3️⃣ 1470. Shuffle the Array

- Mixes two halves of an array into an alternating pattern.

- Builds understanding of index handling and rearranging lists.

- Very useful for practicing basic array manipulation.
  

## 1️⃣ Number of Good Pairs
### Step-by-step explanation

- You are given an array of integers called nums.

- You need to look at two different positions in the array at a time.

- For each pair of positions (i, j), check that i < j.

- Compare the values at those positions: nums[i] and nums[j].

- If both values are equal, then that pair is called a good pair.

- Count all such good pairs and return the total count.
  
## 2️⃣ Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits
### Step-by-step explanation

- You are given a list (array) of integers.

- Take one number at a time from the list.

- Count how many digits that number contains.

- Check whether the digit count is an even number.

- Keep a running count of all numbers that have an even number of digits.

- After checking all the numbers, return the final count.

## 3️⃣ Number of Good Pairs
### Step-by-step explanation

- You are given a list of integers.

- Pick one number and compare it with the numbers that come after it in the list.

- For each comparison, check whether both numbers are equal.

- Make sure the index of the first number is smaller than the index of the second number.

- If both conditions are satisfied, consider it a valid (good) pair.

- Count all such valid pairs and return the total count.


## 4️⃣ How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number
### Step-by-step explanation

- You are given a list of integers.

- Pick one number from the list.

- Compare this number with all other numbers in the list.

- Count how many numbers are smaller than the current number.

- Store this count in the result list at the same position.

- Repeat the process for every number and return the final list of counts.

## 5️⃣ Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer
### Step-by-step explanation

- You are given a single integer number.

- Break the number into its individual digits.

- Calculate the product of all the digits.

- Calculate the sum of all the digits.

- Subtract the sum of the digits from the product of the digits.

- Return the final result.

## 6️⃣ XOR Operation in an Array
### Step-by-step explanation

- You are given two integers: n and start.

- Create an array with length n.

- For each index i, calculate the value using the formula start + 2 × i.

- Store each calculated value in the array.

- Apply the XOR operation between all the elements of the array.

- Return the final XOR result.
